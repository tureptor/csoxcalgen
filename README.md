# csoxcalgen

Simple filter for calendar feeds in the form of ICS files.

The parser is specifically designed to be used with the [feeds from here](https://www.cs.ox.ac.uk/teaching/timetables/)
and will probably fail or give weird outputs for other ICS files unless you modify it for them.

[A github page](https://tureptor.github.io/csoxcalgen/) is set up if you'd like to test it.

## Usage:

1. Obtain some ICS files and select them in the prompt that appears after clicking "Choose files".
2. Click "Start processing" which will group the events and generate corresponding tickboxes.
3. Tick the options that you want, and click "Confirm Selection" to generate the final ICS file.
